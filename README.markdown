# About MorningLightMountain

MorningLightMountain is an alien in Peter Hamilton's sci-fi books Pandora's
Star and Judas Unchained. 

In the 25th century, humans discover a strange energy field in distant space.
Our descendants send an expedition to explore the phenomenon. The energy field
turns out to encapsulate a complete star system. Exploring further, humans find
no way to penetrate the field and gain information from what's within.

Suddenly the whole field disappears, and humans find an array of aggressive
space crafts and weapons heading in their direction. MorningLightMountain has
commenced its nefarious attempt to enslave us...
